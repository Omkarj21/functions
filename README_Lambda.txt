# Anonymous function means that a function is without a name.
# "def" keyword is used to define the normal functions and the "lambda" keyword is used to create anonymous functions.
# Syntax :lambda arguments: expression
# This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# filter :
# Use this when we want output(No change in given members) from given list, like.. find odd, even numbers from given list.
# This will filter out the given list and returns output which satisfies the condition
# Whenever there is action of Find, filter is used.
# ------------------
# map :
# Use this when we want changed output like.. print power 2 of given elements of list
# Also use this when want output as True/False based on given list, like.. Print True if it is Even number else False
# This do the mapping of each element, i.e. it processes every element on the basis of given expression and returns all the data whether it satisfies or not satisfies..
# Whenever there is action of doing operations like power or cube on elements, map is used.
# ------------------
# reduce :
# This performs a repetitive operation over the pairs of the list.
# This is a part of functools module.
# This returns a new reduced result.
