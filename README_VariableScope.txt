# Variable declared outside of the function or in global scope is known as global variable.
# Variable declared inside the function's body or in the local scope is known as local variable.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Keyword :
# Global Keyword only be used inside function body.
# If we want to change value of global variable inside function body in local scope, we have to declare that variable as Global inside function body.
# When we declare as Global then it carries value of that variable outside function body as well.
# Use of global keyword outside a function has no effect
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Nonlocal Keyword :
# Nonlocal variable are used in nested function whose local scope is not defined. This means, the variable can be neither in the local nor the global scope.
